Before
So, this project is to prove that I can identify the different items on a webpage and understand how and why they function.
This project is going to have me review the google homepage, clearly, and test me on my ability to reproduce it concept without directly ripping the content.
The "in browser" features look very appealing, but are still new and I look forward to the experience of using it.
I have learned a lot of feautres in coding html and css, but outside of a tutorial, I am left with more options and a larger chance of failure.
Therefore, I will work hard to recognize my mistakes and note what caused and what solved each instance so I can better my skills for the next time that issue arises.
I'm sure future me will have gone through much confusion, but is left better because of it.
In that note, good luck struggling me and congratulations successful me!
